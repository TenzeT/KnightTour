                 Knight Tour

Overview:

                 This project contains a single class - KnightTour -
                 which simulates a knight chess piece on an 
                 8x8 chess board attempting to make a move to
                 every board square just a single time. A
                 successful 'tour' is returned as a bool True. 
                 The board is printed to the console showing
                 where the night moved and in what order - 
                 starting at 0.

Proposed Solution:

                 Utilizing a 2d array as an 8x8 chess board, the
                 knight will only make legal moves (2 in one
                 direction then 1 perpendicular to the last move
                 direction. Legal moves will be stored from 0-7
                 in two corresponding 1d arrays containing the
                 number of unit changes per respective move. 
                 Legality of moves will be checked so the knight
                 does not move 'off' of the board. An accessibility 
                 heuristic will be added to the chess board's 
                 square for the knight to use as a strategy - the 
                 knight will move to more restricted locations first.
                 Spaces the knight have previously visited will be
                 tracked. 

Milestones:

                1. The knight will make only legal moves. The
                    move-history board will be printed out.
                2. The accessibility heuristic will be implemented.
